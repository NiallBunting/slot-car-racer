Got my prject made some first ideas about it.
Worked on a spike for the control algorithm in CSS

Went to a meeting with DAP
  Topics covered:
    Hardware - aurdino, computer (linux), camera
      PI + PI cam suggested by DAP however I decided it could add a step and
      cause lag.
      Talked about the possible problem if the camera takes too long,
      can then be used more as a check to make sure speed is correct.
      Computer is likely to not have much computing power.
      Diffresnt solutions for tracking - powering each peice of track, having
      sensors all over the track and using the camera.
Worked on spike control algorithm

Tallked to hannah dee about mean shift. She suggested background subtraction
with colour to match each car.

Worked on spike control algorthim.
Send an email to dave about hardware.

Replied to dave about just jusing a usb camera for now
Worked on spike game.
  Watching performance of the slot car spike work it showed that the car
  could wildly variate in lap times depending on how many had been deleted.
  It would often delete many squares leading to a speed up but then the car
  would start to fall off many times that it otherwise would not.
  However, the car could get upto a 150ms speed inrease using this
  algorithm. The speed that car could stay on the track would give lap times
  of 950ms. The algorithm could get that down to 799.
  It suggests that it may take the best of the layouts of the car and stick to
  that.

Went to a meeting with DAP
  Topics covered:
    Hardware - aurdino, computer (linux), camera
      PI + PI cam suggested by DAP however I decided it could add a step and
      cause lag.
      Talked about the possible problem if the camera takes too long,
      can then be used more as a check to make sure speed is correct.
      Computer is likely to not have much computing power.
      Diffresnt solutions for tracking - powering each peice of track, having
      sensors all over the track and using the camera.

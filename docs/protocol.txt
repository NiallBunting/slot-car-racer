Current protocol
================

All messages are sent using characters.

The A/B refers to which track the computer should control.

Computer > Arduino
------------------

A/B,'M'ODE,modeval\n

Sets the mode so the arduino knows how to control.
Mode: 0 - human, 1 - computer

A/B,'P'WM,pwmval\n

pwmval: 0 - 255 (even though physical limits are 60+ and 225 is safe)
0 is not moving.
This is to control the pwm values.

A/B,'G'OTOGATE\n

Brings both cars to the start.

Arduino > Computer
------------------

A/B,'N'OCARPRESENT\n

Tells the computer that the current draw is 0 when voltage applied.
This will check over the course of a few interations.

A/B,'G'ATEPASSED,laptime\n

This tells the computer when the ardunio has passed the gate and the
laptime this was completed in.

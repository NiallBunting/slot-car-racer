Protocol to talk to hardware:

The hardware should recieve commands made of two bytes. The first byte should be the
letter that represents a track. The second should represent the speed for the car to go
(0-255). This should allow the computer to control the cars to a reasonable degree of
accuracy whilst keeping the overhead as low as possible.

Eg:
B255 - Car B full speed.
M0 - Car M stop.

Protocol to talk to computer:

The information the hardware has to return is the speed through the speed trap and the current
draw by each track. This should also follow the two byte format.

For the speed it should be made up of the car number and the amount of milliseconds it takes.
B81 - Car B 81 milliseconds.
M40 - Car M 40 milliseconds.


NOT SURE ABOUT THIS YET.
The hardware should return values when the current draw hits 0. This depends upon how often this happens,
if this can indicate the car is off the track. Or how fast the car is going.

b0 - Car B off the track.
m0 - Car M off the track.
